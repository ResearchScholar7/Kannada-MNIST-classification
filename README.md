# Kannada-MNIST-classification

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying handwritten digits in the Kannada script using the Kannada MNIST dataset. The Kannada MNIST dataset is an extension of the traditional MNIST dataset, specifically designed for Kannada numerals.

Dataset:
The Kannada MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9) in the Kannada script. Each image is 28x28 pixels.

Key Features:

Implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.
Preprocessing scripts for loading and augmenting the Kannada MNIST dataset.
Model training and evaluation scripts.
User-friendly Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and visualization.
